Hello there! I'm Christian. Thanks for visiting my personal blog. As far as a privacy policy goes, I am not collecting any of your information. However, because this website is hosted via GitHub Pages, GitHub may collect information about your site visit. I have no control over what information they collect and how they use it.

I am a junior and cybersecurity major at Grand Canyon University (GCU) in Phoenix, AZ, with an expected graduation date of April 2025. I currently work as a Security Operations Center Analyst for Grand Canyon Education (GCE), and I previously worked as an IT Help Desk Technician and Technical Support Representative for the same company. Outside of academics and work, I am the Director and CompTIA Security+ Study Group Leader of GCU's Technology Club Cyber Committee, a research member of GCU's Cybersecurity Artificial Intelligence Threat Research Development Project, and a fellow of GCU, GCE, and the Arizona Cyber Threat Response Alliance's (ACTRA) Threat Intelligence Support Unit (TISU).

I created this blog to record and document my learning efforts outside of academics and work and to assist others in achieving their career goals in IT and cybersecurity.
